          Hey there, I am glad you stopped by.
          LinkeDan is a place for me to showcase the skills and experiences
          I have gained while working
          as a Full Stack JavaScript Developer. As you will see, I love getting my hands
          dirty with both back and front end challenges. In my years working
          as a Full Stack developer, I have been able to contribute to a large variety of
          codebases, utilize fun and exciting frameworks and libraries, and most
          importantly work with some great and passionate folks. With a can-do attitude,
          the right team, and a proper
          culture any problem can be a joy to solve.

          When I am not crushing some code at Flux Work in New York City,
          I am most likely spending time with my
          lovely wife Lydia and our two year old black lab-mix, Marcy.
          My hobbies include table tennis, traveling, cycling, music, and hiking. I would love
          to hear from you, my contact information is listed above.
